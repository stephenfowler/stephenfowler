- Hi, I’m Stephen
- I’m interested in Auth and security. 
- I’m currently learning all the things. Even though I would say that I am currently learning more about the javascript eco system as well as new auth patterns and practices.  
- I’m looking to collaborate on Teaching kids to code. 
- You can reach me at stephen@fowler.org
